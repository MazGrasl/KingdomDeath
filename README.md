This is a project I've started to remove the need for settlement gear and resource storage sheets (which always seem to run out of space), as well as to show a list of craftable gear with your current resources.
Other features might be added as I see fit.

Tech stack:
Backend/API:
ASP.NET with Entity Framework
SQL express on localhost (but can be exchanged for any other SQL server - just modify appsettings.json)

Client:
Angular with Material
NgRx (Angular Redux)
